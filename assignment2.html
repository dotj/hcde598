            <h1>Overview</h1>

            For this week, we were tasked with creating an updated version of our laser cut press fit construction kit in Grasshopper and Rhino using Grasshopper's parametric modeling features.


            <h2>Materials</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Digital calipers</li>
                <li>Grasshopper & Rhino</li>
                <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
                <li>Different types of cardboard</li>
                <li>Laser Cutter</li>
            </ul>


            <h1>Ideation</h1>

            <p>After last week's assignment, I wanted to experiment more with scoring the cardboard and further differentiating the leaf/petal shape. I decided that I wanted to try to find a way to score the cardboard in such a way that it would curve slightly like a petal or a leaf.</p>


            <p>I made a bunch of different prototypes using thick cardboard, thin cardboard/cardstock, and paper, and experimented with different ways to bend and curl the leaf/petal. After several iterations, I chose a design in which the base of the leaf is cut and then overlapped to make the leaf cup together. A simple score pattern would allow the leaf to bend more easily and I would slot the overlapping base pieces into a slot that would fit 2x the width of the cardboard. (I also decided to just make the second piece a leaf because I wanted a more obvious point to differentiate it from the circular base pieces.) </p>

            </p>

            <h1>Design</h1>

            I chose a modified design in which I have a circular base node with both regular and double-width slots, as well as a scored leaf with overlapping slots at the base.

            <h2>Learning Grasshopper and Rhino</h2>

            <p>I spent the majority of my time on this project familiarizing myself with Grasshopper. I have previously worked with Solidworks for parametric modeling so I understood the value of learning Grasshopper. Grasshopper also uses very "mathy" terms and it was strange (and facinating) to see objects described this way.</p>

            <p>I struggled quite a bit with the organization of the nodes. Things got messy real fast and I quickly got confused because everything so scattered. I'm sure I will learn more tricks in due time, but at the moment I constantly felt very, very lost</p>

            <p>Conceptually, the idea of moving objects around programatically came fairly naturally to me (even if the implementation took a bit of trial and error). I made a big effor to keep things organized so most of my time was spent poking around and trying to find ways to make things more clear to me.

            </p>

            <h2>Ctrl+G/Cmd+G</h2>

            <p>The biggest breakthrough for me was understanding out to use the grouping function! I managed to figure out how to do it on the UI once by accident, and couldn't reproduce it, so then I simply tried "ctrl+G" and it worked...</p>

            <p><em>SIGH.</em></p>

            </p>


            <h2>Exporting and Setup</h2>

            <p>I had previously set my units to inches in Rhino, and didn't run into any issues exporting from Rhino to .dxf to Illustrator. Others were not quite so lucky. I don't really have any insight on this, I think I just got lucky.</p>

            </p>


            <h2>Scoring with the Laser Cutter</h2>

            <p>In order to score the cardboard, I found <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.12/people/pip/WK2/wk2.html">this project site</a> which outlined the steps to score the cardboard. In Illustrator, I made the lines where the cardboard neede dto be cut or scored, and mapped those colors in the Epilog laser cutter preferences. (Unfortunately, I forgot to take a screenshot of this.)</p>

            <h1>Results</h1>

            <p>In total, I made 1 full kit with the thinner cardboard (12 leaves and 12 base nodes), and a half kit with the thicker cardboard.</p>

            <p>Thick cardboard:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Width: 0.124"</li>
                <li>Slot width: 0.112"</li>
                <li>Laser cutter score settings: 100 speed, 30 power, 50 frequency</li>
                <li>Laser cutter cut settings: 40 speed, 100 power, 50 frequency</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Thin cardboard:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Width: 0.060"</li>
                <li>Slot width: 0.050"</li>
                <li>Laser cutter score settings: 100 speed, 10 power, 50 frequency</li>
                <li>Laser cutter cut settings: 70 speed, 100 power, 50 frequency</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Overall, the effect wasn't *quite* what I wanted but I was able to pick up a bit of Grasshopping and experiment with scoring and bending cardboard. The bent cardboard worked much better with the thinner material. I think my previous iteration was more flexible and easier to assemble and play with. I would have liked to spend more time iterating on the shape and angle of the leaf in particular, and perhaps find more interesting patterns to score the leaf on.</p>
