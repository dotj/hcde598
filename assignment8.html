            <h1>Overview</h1>

            <p>I made a lamp with two layers of patterned lampshades. The inner lampshade rotates in order to create patterns with the outer lampshade.</p>


            <h1>Ideation and Concept</h1>

            <p>I wanted to play with light and have layers of moveable lampshades that would combine to create a lamp with dynamic light patterns. I also started the project with the assumption that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">everything that can go wrong, will go wrong (Murphy's Law)...</a> especially in a lab setting with limited resources for 40+ people, so I intentionally played it safe.</p>

            <h1>Process</h1>

            <h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>LED Pendant Lamp from Target.</li>
                <li>White Posterboard from Bartell's</li>
                <li>Plastic Rivets from Joshua.</li>
                <li>Delrin - 1/8" from Amazon</li>
                <li>3D Filament from Fluke</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Techniques</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Moving parts: Lamp base</li>
                <li>Laser cutting: Lamp base and lamp shade</li>
                <li>3D Printing: Knobs for the rotating mechanism.</li>
                <li>Parametric modelling: Lamp shade</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Lamp Base</h2>

            <p>I designed the lamp base mainly in Onshape. After a couple of iterations, I decided to make it big enough for a cylindrical lampshade design because I found the spherical shape a little too large. A cylindrical shape means I won't need to find a way to build the scaffolding for the paper lamp shade. In addition, the base has a track in the middle that will allow for us to fit in rivets that carry a secondary lamp shade on the inside. I also created 3D printed knobs, which are hollow spheres with a hole at the bottom sized to snap onto the rivet and hold them in place.</p>

            </p>

            <h2>Lamp Shade</h2>

            
            <p>I calculated the required length and width for two lamp shades and used Grasshopper and Rhino to create patterns on the lamp shade. I initially experimented with variable patterns using attractors and dynamic spacing, though I wasn't happy with those patterns. I ended up sticking with a linearly-spaced pattern with a hyperbolic curve.</p>
            
            <p>I used the laser cutter at Fluke which had a slightly different workflow than the Mill machines, but also afforded much better control. Cutting a single sheet resulted in a lot of burn marks, so I cut two pieces together so that the bottom piece would catch most of the burn marks.</p>
            
            <p>I originally planned to also cut out regularly spaced cut strips on the top of the lampshades to bond with the lamp, but forgot before cutting, so I used small strips of paper to fix the shape to the Delrin base. I had planned to try superglue, which seemed to work for bonding leftover delrin pieces, but eventually decided to simply tape it so that I can iterate on the lampshade in the future.</p>

            </p>

            <h1>Results</h1>

            <p>The lamp was easy to put together and I didn't get caught in the mad laser cutter chaos at the MILL. The end result was simple but satisfying (even if it makes my apartment smell like BBQ). I'm glad I tried using the Fluke machines, because everything worked far better for me. And while I didn't take too many chances with this project, I found that I was <em>much</em> less intimidated by the idea of designing and fabricating something new when I needed it.</p>

            <p>The revolving mechanism worked just as expected. The light from the lamp is nicely diffused from far away, and makes a soft, pleasing "flicker" when the inner shade is rotated. I would definitely like to iterate in the future and find a cleaner way to fix the lampshade to the base, as well as design more interesting lampshades.</p>
