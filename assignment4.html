            <h1>Ideation</h1>

            <p>Revisiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium again: there was a temporary exhibit on cephalopods a couple years ago with the theme of robot cephalopods, which is awesome. This class also seems to like cephalopods. A little while back, my coworker had an awesome 3D printed cephalopod on her desk. Clearly, I was going to do something cephalopod-themed this week, so I decided to make a little cephalopod puppet.</p>

            <h1>Process</h1>

            <h2>Octopus</h2>

            <p>I started by 3D printing the mini octopus. Since I didn't design it, it was just a process of trial-and-error until I got the print settings right. I ended up scaling it at 75% and printing at the lowest quality to make it relatively quick.</p>

            <h2>Movement #345</h2>

            I designed my mechanism around Movement #345 from 507 Movements. I essentially rebuilt the mechanism without the piston body and with a box to enclose the cam, or "egg thing".

            <p align="middle">

                <br><small><em>I think this is called a cam but I wasn't sure, so I kept the name as "egg thing"...</em></small></br>
            </p>


            <h2>Learning Onshape</h2>

            I found learning Onshape to be relatively straightforward once i got used to the interface. I mostly used rotating mates, as well as a tangent mate to mock the rod sticking through the slot on the top of the box.

            </p>


            <h2>Iterations and Life Lessons</h2>

            Long story short, I designed my first model on material I wasn't sure I would have access to, and then went back to resign for 1/8" material as a backup since I had cardboard that width. Without that spacer, I wouldn't be able to make my mechanism rotate a full 360 degrees.

            <p>Pro tip: Don't design for something you don't have.</p>

            </p>


            <h2>Version 2</h2>

            After that, I went back to the drawing board and made some revisions to my design, including a lot of organizational improvements. I put the thicknesses of the material into variables so I could more easily account for different materials as needed.

                <br><small><em>Using dimensions made it really simple to make revisions to the design.</em></small></br>
            </p>

            <h2>Laser-cutting Delrin</h2>

            <p>On Tuesday, I finally got ahold of the delrin! But first, I prototyped in cardboard and quickly realized that the design was far too small. I forgot to account for the cap of the rivet, so if my prototype wasn't cardboard (and bendable), I wouldn't have been able to move the mechanism at all. However, I was able to quickly make changes to the dimensions of the sketches, and cut it again in cardboard in order to test a larger design.</p>

                <br><small><em>Animation of the smaller design.</em></small></br>
            </p>

            <p>Once I was happy with the final design, I cut it out in @JoshuaV's Delrin with the laser cutter settings: 5% speed, 100% power, 50% frequency.</p>

            <p align="middle">

                <br><small><em>Cut out delrin is so satisfying!</em></small></br>
            </p>


            <h1>Results</h1>

            <p>While this took a little longer than I expected, I learned a lot from my second round of revisions and I'm glad I was finally able to cut with the Delrin in the end. The delrin is a joy to cut and the mechanism was smooth and satisfying to play with.</p>
