            <h1>Overview</h1>

            This week, we made a lamp using both 3D printed and laser-cut parts.

            <h1>Ideation</h1>

            <p>When thinking about light, I thought of aquariums and windows into different scenes. I used to live on the central coast of California and I would often visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where the glass was a window into a different world.</p>


            <p>As a caveat, the stars did not align for me this week and I was not going to have time during the weekend to be in lab, which meant I wouldn't have much time to test and iterate. Since I would have a very limited time in lab, I tried to design mine to be as simple as possible but also extensible. I made my lamp a simple box with the intent of eventually layering colored paper in there to create scenes.</p>


            <h1>Design</h1>

            <p>I wanted to make mine a simple cube made from one piece of cardboard with a simple locking mechanism to hold it together. I made use of my knowledge from last week and decided to just cut out the 5 sides of the open box, and then score the inside edges to make it easy to bend.  I also cut out another band that would wrap around the bottom of the box to hold it all together.</p>

            </p>
            <p align="middle">

                <br><small><em>Using the mockup of my lamp and lampshade to quickly see how the bracket would fit.</em></small></br>
            </p>

            <p>I also designed a snap-on bracket for my light that was going to be as simple and light as possible so that I would be able to iterate if needed in the hours I would be able to stay in lab. The snap-on bracket consists of an arc/partial ring that would snap onto the box, as well as arms and cross-supports that would fit into slots cut into the cardboard box.</p>

            <p align="middle">

                <br><small><em>Fun screenshot of my attempt to make an arc. I am still fumbling with Grasshopper a bit.</em></small></br>
            </p>

            <p>Originally, I thought of scoring the inside of the cardboard box in order to have a place to slide in paper designs, but it would make angling the box a bit awkward. So for this iteration, I didn't score the inside of the cardboard and just opted to create the window for now. I designed the box in Illustrator simply because I thought it would be quicker for me at the moment.</p>


            <h1>Process</h1>

            <h2>Snap-on bracket</h2>

            <p>I waffled a bit on whether I should design my bracket in Grasshopper or in Rhino. I ended up making my bracket entirely in Grasshopper so I could quickly edit the thicknesses and widths if I needed to. In addition, I figured I would want to print some very quick test pieces, and making my bracket in Grasshopper allowed for me to easily separate and bake the different components of the bracket. I baked and exported the partial ring that would snap onto the lamp which would serve as a quick test for the 3D printer settings, flexibility of the material, and fit of the bracket. I designed with the speed of the print in mind, so I would load the stupid triangle list into the Dremel application in order to estimate the printing time. The test ring was estimated to take about 2 minutes to print, and the total bracket was estimated to take about 20 minutes to print.</p>

            </p>
 
            <p>I was fortunate in that everything pretty much went according to plan! I printed 2 test rings and adjusted my model as necessary, which was very quick since I had built the entire thing in Grasshopper. My entire bracket printed in less than 20 minutes (even though the printer listed 19+ hours...) and I was thrilled! It also snapped on my lamp very nicely and was sturdier than I expected.</p>

                <br><small><em>First pass at the bracket. I forgot to set the cross bar further away from the center so the top of the lamp wouldn't fit. Luckily, I was able to edit it and print out another one in 20 minutes!</em></small></br>
            </p>
            

            <h2>Lamp shade</h2>

            <p>I also noodled a bit on whether I should try to use Rhino/Grasshopper for the cardboard box since it was such a simple shape, though there were some strategically places slots that I needed to account for. I ended up using Illustrator since I hadn't practiced creating the laser cut patterns with Rhino yet, and I figured that would take more debugging than I had the patience or time for at the moment.</p>

            <p>For the laser-cut cardboard, I initially cut a tiny version in order to ensure that everything cuts the way I expect. I run into some issues with the color mapping not working properly because Illustrator was set to CYMK color instead of RGB. After I got that properly set, I successfully cut out a small test piece. However, the full piece did not cut all the way as I had expected, and I ended up using a blade to finish some of the cuts.</p>

            <p>As mentioned earlier, I had originally wanted to laser cut colored paper to create tiny scenes. While I never got there, I did find this piece of origami left over from an activity at the Mill, which also happened to fit nicely with the box while also adding some interesting patterns.</p>

            </p>

            <p>I set out to make the simplest and easiest solution I could think of that still looked relatively elegant, and astonishingly, things went to plan! I certainly wish I had a little more time and ability to allow myself to be creative with the design of the lamp, but I was able fully to embrace the philosophy of rapid prototyping and push out something functional in the end.</p>
