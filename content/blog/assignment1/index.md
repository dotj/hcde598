For our first digital fabrication assignment, we were tasked to make a laser cut press fit construction kit consisting of at least 12 instances of one unique part.

# Materials

- Digital calipers
- Adobe Illustrator
- Card stock/thin cardboard
- Regular cardboard
- Laser Cutter

# Ideation

Since cherry blossoms have been on everyone’s mind (including mine), I wanted to take some inspiration the cherry blossom trees to guide the design of my kit. I recently learned the difference between cherry blossoms and plum blossoms—the petals of plum blossoms are smooth while the petals of cherry blossoms have a small split at the end. I figured that I could construct the petals with cardboard and the split would be a natural place for a split to go! Spoiler alert: the similarities to a cherry blossom end here, but I still designed with the idea of a plant form in mind.

In addition, I knew I wanted to make my kit a “lego-like” set that could be reconfigured in many different forms.

# Design

I had a couple of false starts in the process of designing my kit. I started by trying to sketch out what I thought the kit would look like assembled. This was a mistake, because I had a really hard time sketching and visualizing how everything would fit together in 3D. I also installed Rhino to try to model the design, but I was also unfamiliar with Rhino so this ended up being a futile attempt.

I realized that I needed to prototype with paper or card stock in order to get a “feel” for how the objects would work together before I could even begin to try to model something on a computer. I practiced sketching some cherry blossoms and plants partly for fun and partly to help me decide on which base shapes to build with. I manually cut out various shapes with card stock (from a box of thin mints, thanks Girl Scouts!) with notches to prototype.

I initially wanted to have a polygonal base for the branch/stem/base and a circular base for the leaf. The polygonal shapes didn’t feel quite right to me, and I was still very attached to the leaf, so I ended up going with two circular-ish bases.

1. Part A is a perfectly circular and have 5 evenly-spaced notches, and
2. Part B is a leaf/petal shape with a round base and a pointed tip, and will have 4 notches including the famous cherry blossom split.

With that in mind, I created those shapes in vector format with Illustrator. This was a fairly straightforward task after drawing out the shapes on paper. At this point, I still wasn’t entirely sure how everything would fit together, but I decided to roll with it and see what happens.

# Testing

I created a test file ready with some of the shapes cut and a “comb” with varying widths of notches. This test file was meant to help me figure out the right width for my notch and the right settings for the laser cutter. I measured my cardboard a couple times and got widths between 0.120” and 0.136”, so I designed the comb to have notches with widths within that range in increments of 0.004”. I placed the more narrow notches closer together so I could more easily identify which one I was testing with.

Interestingly, the smallest (0.120”) notch fit the best, but was still a bit loose! I created another test comb with widths between 0.108” and 0.124”, and found that 0.112” was the best fit. It was just a tad too tight, but I wanted to be able to build structures that might not necessarily be balanced, but could still stay together.

The test file also helped me quickly identify which settings worked best for my cardboard. I was a little antsy at least, so I kept the speed higher (at 75%) and the power lower (at 50%), which did not result in a catastrophic fire and a ban from the makerspace, but also did not cut through the cardboard. After a bit of trial and error, I found that my ideal settings were: 40% speed and 100% power.

After finding the right slot width and laser cutter settings as well as making some adjustments to the design, I cut out all 24 pieces.

# Results

- 24 pieces total
- Notch width of 0.112”
- Laser cutter set at 40% speed and 100% power

## What went well:

Prototyping with card stock proved to be invaluable, even if the final result ended up way different! It was much easier for me to visualize how the pieces would fit together when I was able to work with the pieces directly. In addition, the “comb” test was helpful. It helped me quickly and efficiently find the right notch width and laser cutter settings.

## Things I would do differently:

I probably went a little overboard and made the notch a tad too small, so I would have adjusted the width a bit more. I also didn’t need to make my pieces so… tiny. I would have liked to experiment with scoring the cardboard and making bends, especially since my concept was based off an organic shape. Perhaps I could make some curly leaves or a stem. Finally, I would like to revisit this project with better 3D modeling skills.

Overall, I think the result turned out better than I expected! I thought I had an idea of how I wanted to put the pieces together for this assignment, and I thought I would end up with an unimpressive pinwheel. I did end up with an unimpressive pinwheel, but I quickly built upon that structure to make a more flower-like shape that I hadn’t even envisioned in my prototype.
