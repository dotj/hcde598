# Overview

This week, we made a lamp using both 3D printed and laser-cut parts.

## Materials

- Digital calipers
- Grasshopper & Rhino
- Adobe Illustrator
- Different types of cardboard
- Laser Cutter
- 3D Printer Filament
- 3D Printer
- Ikea Lamp

# Ideation

When thinking about light, I thought of aquariums and windows into different scenes. I used to live on the central coast of California and I would often visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where the glass was a window into a different world.

As a caveat, the stars did not align for me this week and I was not going to have time during the weekend to be in lab, which meant I wouldn't have much time to test and iterate. Since I would have a very limited time in lab, I tried to design mine to be as simple as possible but also extensible. I made my lamp a simple box with the intent of eventually layering colored paper in there to create scenes.

# Design

I wanted to make mine a simple cube made from one piece of cardboard with a simple locking mechanism to hold it together. I made use of my knowledge from last week and decided to just cut out the 5 sides of the open box, and then score the inside edges to make it easy to bend.  I also cut out another band that would wrap around the bottom of the box to hold it all together.

I also designed a snap-on bracket for my light that was going to be as simple and light as possible so that I would be able to iterate if needed in the hours I would be able to stay in lab. The snap-on bracket consists of an arc/partial ring that would snap onto the box, as well as arms and cross-supports that would fit into slots cut into the cardboard box.

Originally, I thought of scoring the inside of the cardboard box in order to have a place to slide in paper designs, but it would make angling the box a bit awkward. So for this iteration, I didn't score the inside of the cardboard and just opted to create the window for now. I designed the box in Illustrator simply because I thought it would be quicker for me at the moment.

# Process
 
## Snap-on bracket

I waffled a bit on whether I should design my bracket in Grasshopper or in Rhino. I ended up making my bracket entirely in Grasshopper so I could quickly edit the thicknesses and widths if I needed to. In addition, I figured I would want to print some very quick test pieces, and making my bracket in Grasshopper allowed for me to easily separate and bake the different components of the bracket. I baked and exported the partial ring that would snap onto the lamp which would serve as a quick test for the 3D printer settings, flexibility of the material, and fit of the bracket. I designed with the speed of the print in mind, so I would load the stupid triangle list into the Dremel application in order to estimate the printing time. The test ring was estimated to take about 2 minutes to print, and the total bracket was estimated to take about 20 minutes to print.

I was fortunate in that everything pretty much went according to plan! I printed 2 test rings and adjusted my model as necessary, which was very quick since I had built the entire thing in Grasshopper. My entire bracket printed in less than 20 minutes (even though the printer listed 19+ hours...) and I was thrilled! It also snapped on my lamp very nicely and was sturdier than I expected.

## Lamp shade

I also noodled a bit on whether I should try to use Rhino/Grasshopper for the cardboard box since it was such a simple shape, though there were some strategically places slots that I needed to account for. I ended up using Illustrator since I hadn't practiced creating the laser cut patterns with Rhino yet, and I figured that would take more debugging than I had the patience or time for at the moment.

For the laser-cut cardboard, I initially cut a tiny version in order to ensure that everything cuts the way I expect. I run into some issues with the color mapping not working properly because Illustrator was set to CYMK color instead of RGB. After I got that properly set, I successfully cut out a small test piece. However, the full piece did not cut all the way as I had expected, and I ended up using a blade to finish some of the cuts.

As mentioned earlier, I had originally wanted to laser cut colored paper to create tiny scenes. While I never got there, I did find this piece of origami left over from an activity at the Mill, which also happened to fit nicely with the box while also adding some interesting patterns.

I set out to make the simplest and easiest solution I could think of that still looked relatively elegant, and astonishingly, things went to plan! I certainly wish I had a little more time and ability to allow myself to be creative with the design of the lamp, but I was able fully to embrace the philosophy of rapid prototyping and push out something functional in the end.
